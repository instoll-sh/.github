## Hi there 👋

This is the organization for [**instoll**](https://github.com/instoll-sh/instoll) and related tools

On behalf of the organization, **we encourage developers to add install.sh to their tool repository** so that people can install it using [**instoll**](https://github.com/instoll-sh/instoll) 😉

---

Let's grow the package ecosystem with **install.sh**! ♻️💪
